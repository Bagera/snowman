# "Arrays": Snowman (v1.3)

## Summary

[Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) are a collection of values. Each value in an array is assigned an *index*, which is a number that corresponds to the position of that item or element in the array. In JavaScript, arrays are *zero-based*, meaning the first element in the array is given the index `0`. Arrays have many built-in methods and other features for your use. You can create an array by assigning a variable to the array literal, which is a pair of brackets (`[]`): `<% s.myArray = [] %>`.

[Specific elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Accessing_array_elements) can be accessed in an array by following its variable name with a pair of brackets containing the index to check. Testing whether an array contains an element can be done using the [*Array#includes()* function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes); adding new items can be doone using the [*Array#push()* function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push).
